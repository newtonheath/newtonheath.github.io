## Ingredients

* 3 cups whole milk
* 1 vanilla bean (or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract)
* 6 large egg yolks
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* Pinch of salt

## Steps

1. If using a vanilla bean, split it lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Add both pod and seeds to the milk in a medium saucepan. If using extract, you'll add it at the end.
1. Heat the milk mixture over medium heat until it just starts to simmer (small bubbles around the edges). Remove from heat and let steep for 10 minutes if using vanilla bean.
1. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks, sugar, and salt until pale and slightly thickened.
1. Slowly pour about 1 cup of the hot milk into the egg mixture while whisking constantly (this tempers the eggs to prevent scrambling).
1. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining milk, whisking constantly.
1. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon (about 5-7 minutes). When you run your finger across the coated spoon, it should leave a clear path.
1. Immediately strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl.
1. If using vanilla extract instead of bean, stir it in now.
1. Place the bowl in an ice bath and stir occasionally until cooled.

Tips:
* The sauce will keep refrigerated for up to 3 days. This recipe yields about 3.5 cups of crème anglaise.
* Never let it boil or the eggs will scramble
* Keep stirring to prevent the bottom from scorching
* The sauce will thicken more as it cools
* If it gets too thick, thin with a little warm milk
