20 minute recipe.

## Ingredients

### Chicken

- 2-4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (1 1/2 pound total), or 4-8 chicken cutlets
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Pinch ground black pepper
- 3 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
- 4 Tbsp olive oil
- 4 Tbsp butter

### Sauce

- 1/2 cup chicken stock or dry white wine (such as a Sauvignon Blanc)
- 2 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1/4 cup brined capers

### Garnish

- 2 Tbsp fresh chopped parsley

## Steps

### Chicken

1. Slice or pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness
1. Mix together the flour, salt, pepper, and grated Parmesan. Rinse the chicken pieces in water. Cover them thoroughly in the flour mixture, until well coated.
1. Heat olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet on medium high heat.
1. Add half of the chicken pieces, do not crowd the pan. Brown well on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pan and reserve to a plate. Repeat for remaining chicken.

### Chicken

1. Add the chicken stock or white wine, lemon juice, and capers to the pan. Use a spatula to scrape up the browned bits. Reduce the sauce by half.
1. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.

### Serve

Plate the chicken and serve with the sauce poured over the chicken. Sprinkle with parsley.
