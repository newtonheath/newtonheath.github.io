## Ingredients

* 1 cup yellow lentils (toor dal)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons turmeric
* 1 teaspoon green chili or jalapeño, seeded and minced
* 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup tamarind concentrate or 1/2 tablespoon fresh lime juice
* 2 tablespoons sunflower oil
* 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 12 curry leaves (optional)
* 3 teapoons chopped fresh cilantro

## Steps

1. Combine the dal, turmeric, chili, salt, and 4 cups of water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles aggressively and steadily cook, uncovered, for 25 minutes.
1. Add the tamarind concentrate and 1/2 cup additional water, and left bubble for another minute. Turn off the heat. Use an Indian mathani to purée the dal for about 1 minute; the dal should be saucy, but not soupy.
1. To make the tadka, heat the oil in a small saucepan over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and cover the pan; let the seeds pop and sizzle. When the popping begins to subside, add the garlic and cook until lightly browned, about 15 seconds. Add the curry leaves, if you are using them. Cover the pan (to prevent spattering) and cook for about 10 seconds, allowing flavors to meld.
1. Pour the tadka into the dal; stir gently to combine. Garnish with cilantro and serve.
