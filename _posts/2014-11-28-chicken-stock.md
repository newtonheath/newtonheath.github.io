## Ingredients

* 1 meaty chicken carcass
* 1 small onion, sliced
* 1 carrot, roughly chopped
* 1 celery stick, sliced
* 1 bouquet garni
* 1 teaspoon white peppercorns

## Steps

Break or chop carcass into manageable pieces. Put it in a large saucepan with 3 pints of cold water. Bring to the boil; skim the surface. Add the remaining ingredients, lower the heat and simmer for 3-4 hours. Cool quickly, then strain. Skim off surface fat. Season and use as required.
