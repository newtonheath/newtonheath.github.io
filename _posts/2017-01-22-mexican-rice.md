## Ingredients

* 1 large clove garlic, roughly chopped
* 2 cups canned tomatoes (fresh tomatoes can be used)
* 1/2 cup green bell pepper, roughly chopped
* 1 medium onion, roughly chopped
* 1/2 medium jalapeño, seeds and veins removed
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup chicken stock or water
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 heaping cup long-grain white rice, rinsed

## Steps

1. Blend vegetables, salt and stock or water together into a mostly smooth purée (a few small pieces of onion and pepper are fine).
1. In a large skillet with a tightfitting lid, heat oil.
1. Add rice and toast until it absorbs most of the oil and begins to smell nutty.
1. Add blended ingredients, stir gently with a wooden spoon to prevent breaking up the rice too much and bring to a light boil.
1. Cover, reduce heat to the lowest setting possible and cook undisturbed for 17 minutes.
1. Let sit for another 10 minutes.
