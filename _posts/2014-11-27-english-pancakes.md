## Ingredients

* 100g/4 oz plain flour
* 1.25 ml/1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 egg, beaten
* 250ml/8 fluid oz milk
* Oil for frying

## Steps

1. Make the batter. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the center and add the beaten egg. Stir in half the milk, gradually working the flour down from the sides.
1. Beat vigorously until the mixture is smooth and bubbly, then stir in the rest of the milk. Pour intoa jug. The mixture may be left to stand at this stage, in which case it should be covered and stored in the regrigerator.
1. Heat a little of the oil in a clean 7 inch pancake pan, Pour off any excess oil, leaving the pan covered with a thin film of grease. Stir the batter and pout about 2- tablespoons into the pan. There should be just enough to thinly cover the base. Tilt and rotate the pan so that the batter runs over the surface evenly.
1. Cook over moderate heat for about 1 minute until the pancake is set and golden brown underneath. Make sure the pancake is loose by shaking the pan, then either toss it or turn it with a palette knife or a fish slice. Cook the second side for about 30 seconds or until golden.
1. Slide the pancake out onto a warmed plate. Serve at once, with a suitable filling or sauce, or keep warm over simmering water or in a very low oven while making more pankcakes in the same way. Add more oil to the pan when necessary.
