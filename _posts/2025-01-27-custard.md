## Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons Bird's Custard powder
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 3 cups (500ml) milk
* Pinch of salt

## Steps

1. Before heating, whisk the ingredients together thoroughly while cold to avoid lumps.
1. Place the saucepan over medium heat.
1. Stir constantly with a whisk or wooden spoon while heating. This is important to prevent lumps from forming.
1. Continue stirring until the mixture starts to thicken and comes to a gentle simmer (about 5-7 minutes).
1. Once it reaches your desired thickness, remove from heat. Keep in mind it will thicken slightly more as it cools.

## Tips

* If you prefer a thicker custard, you can add an extra 1/2 tablespoon of custard powder
* If it becomes too thick, thin it with a little warm milk
* For a richer taste, you can replace some of the milk with cream
* Serve warm or cold, depending on your preference
