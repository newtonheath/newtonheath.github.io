## Ingredients

* 2 cups heavy whipping cream (cold)
* 2 tablespoons powdered sugar (also called confectioner's sugar)
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

## Steps

1. Start with COLD cream - this is crucial for the best results. Even chill your mixing bowl and beaters in the freezer for 15 minutes if you can
1. Pour the cold heavy cream into your mixing bowl
1. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla (if using)
1. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until the cream starts to thicken
1. Increase to medium-high speed and continue beating until soft peaks form (when you lift the beater, the peaks should gently fall over)
1. For firmer whipped cream, continue beating until stiff peaks form (peaks stand straight up when beaters are lifted)

## Tips

* Don't overbeat or you'll get butter
* Watch carefully once soft peaks form - it can turn to butter quickly
* If whipping by hand with a whisk, it will take longer but works just as well
* Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours
