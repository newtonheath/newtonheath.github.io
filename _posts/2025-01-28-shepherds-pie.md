## Ingredients:

### Filling

- [ ] 1 lb ground beef or vegetarian substitute
- [ ] 1 onion, diced
- [ ] 2 carrots, diced
- [ ] 1/2 cup dry red wine (like Merlot or Cabernet)
- [ ] 1 cup frozen peas
- [ ] 2 tbsp tomato paste
- [ ] 1 cup vegetable broth
- [ ] 1 tsp dried thyme
- [ ] 1 tsp dried rosemary
- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste

### Mash

- [ ] 2 lbs potatoes, peeled and quartered
- [ ] 1/2 cup plant-based milk
- [ ] 4 tbsp vegan butter
- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Boil potatoes in salted water until tender (about 15-20 minutes). Drain, then mash with plant-based milk, vegan butter, salt, and pepper until smooth.
3. In a large skillet over medium heat, sauté onion and carrots until softened (about 5 minutes).
4. Add Beyond Meat and break it up while cooking until browned (about 5 minutes).
5. Pour in the red wine and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes to cook off the alcohol and concentrate the flavor.
6. Add tomato paste, herbs, salt, and pepper. Cook for 1 minute.
7. Add vegetable broth, bring to a simmer, and cook until slightly thickened (about 5-7 minutes).
8. Stir in frozen peas.
9. Transfer filling to a 9x13 baking dish. Top with mashed potatoes, spreading evenly. Create texture on top with a fork if desired.
10. Bake for 25-30 minutes until potatoes are lightly browned and filling is bubbling.

Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

## Try

- Different combos of herbs: sage, bay, rosemary, thyme, maybe paprika.
- Corn flour to thicken
- Parsnip and carrot
- Celery (2)
