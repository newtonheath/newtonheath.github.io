## Steps

1. Place soup ingredients in a pan, simmer with the lid on, and cook for 10 minutes
1. Transfer the sacue into a blender, and blend all ingredients (can seive, but have not tried)
1. In a pan, melt butter on low heat
1. Add flour and cook for a few minutes, longer to make the color darker - if roux caramelizes (smell), begin again
1. Add milk slowly, ensuring each addition is mixed in until smooth - will clump at first
1. Add roux to base and warm through slowly, without bringing to a boil
